Hi Corrado

Here at Ohpen, we work with technologies such as WCF, Linq, Lambda and a few coding principles with the .NET framework. 

We do *not* require you to show us your skills in mentioned frameworks, however, need to understand your level of knowledge, experience, and applied skills.

To validate your C# coding knowledge and programming skills we would like you to:

1. Build 'a service' in C# that ...
2. Follows the SOLID principles and ...
3. Exposes the operations as described in the assignment

Write the service the way that is most close to how you currently develop.

This test shall present us your production level coding style and quality. Choose your approach carefully, what will you cover and what is the bonus?

Keep in mind (1) unit tests and (2) test application to prove your application works.

Create a service that:

- accepts a human-readable typical piece of text 

- - e.g. chapter from a book, 
  - not just a string of characters, 
  - but actually, a couple of paragraphs of text with all kinds of (un)expected characters). 

The following operations must be supported by the service:

1. Sort( text, sort option )
2. GenerateStatistics( text )

- The first method must return the given text in the given sorted way, there should be three possible sorting options available. 
- The second method must return a complex data type that will tell the consumer how many hyphens, words and spaces are inside the given text. 
- The complex data type must be called TextStatistics.
